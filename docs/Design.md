# Institutional Private Credit Rail

This system is an on-chain credit rail that connects
off-chain underwriting decisions to on-chain capital allocation.

It is not:
- A legal enforcement system
- A KYC provider
- A liquidation-based lending protocol
- A trustless system

It is:
- An accounting and incentive enforcement layer
- A risk allocation engine
- A cryptographic verification bridge
- A protocol primitive for institutional credit pools
