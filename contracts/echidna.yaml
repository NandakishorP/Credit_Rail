# Echidna Configuration for Credit Rail
# Target contract: EchidnaCreditRailTest

# 1. Testing Mode
# We use 'assertion' mode because your tests use `assertEq` / `assert`.
testMode: assertion

# 2. Coverage Guidance
# Echidna saves "interesting" inputs (those that increase coverage) here.
# This allows it to "learn" the sequence: create -> activate -> default -> writeOff.
corpusDir: "corpus"
timeout: 600
# 3. Fuzzing Parameters
# 50,000 runs is a good balance for local testing.
testLimit: 1000000000
# Max sequence length. 100 is deep enough to perform multiple loan lifecycles.
seqLen: 100
# Effort to simplify failing test cases (makes debugging easier).
shrinkLimit: 5000

# 4. Source Interpretation
# Tell Echidna to use Foundry's build system to resolve imports/remappings.
cryticArgs: ['--compile-force-framework', 'foundry']

# 5. Contract Configuration
# Deployer address (arbitrary but consistent)
deployer: "0x41414141"
# Available senders for calls
sender: ["0x10000", "0x20000", "0x30000"]
